![Example build environment](./Docs/lcm-arm-cmsis-vscode.jpg "Example build environment")

Build scripts are also included: `LCM/build.sh` (Linux / Mac OS) `LCM/build.bat` (Windows) 

They build firmware for all 4 configurations, then copy the created `<device>.hex` files into the `LCM` directory. The intention is to use them when releasing new versions until a future solution is reached.
